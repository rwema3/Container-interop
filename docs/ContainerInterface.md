Container interface
===================

This document describes a common interface for dependency injection containers.

The goal set by `ContainerInterface` is to standardize how frameworks and libraries make use of a
container to obtain objects and parameters (called *entries* in the rest of this document).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].
